## ðŸ“š Project Structure

The application follows the MVC architecture:

- **Model**: Handles the data and business logic.
- **View**: Contains the UI components (console-based or GUI depending on implementation).
- **Controller**: Manages user input, updates the model, and updates the view.
- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: Separates the persistence logic and uses JDBC to interact with the database.
